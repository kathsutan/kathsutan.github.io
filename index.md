### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I was able to apply 
    code from lectures to create blackjack. It was when I started to 
    understand more of the concepts I learned in class and apply it to the 
    lab. I was able to see how the concepts worked together and on top of 
    that, learn how blackjack fully worked!

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was also my favorite lab because it was one of the first
    labs that had different files incorporated with the code. There were
    different files that we had to take into consideration, which I wasnâ€™t 
    used to. I was able to understand a little bit more about how I could
    take code from other files and use it towards the code in the file I
    was working on.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 Part 1 was also one of my favorite labs because it was where we 
    started playing a bit more with colors and animations. We were also able
    to interact with new libraries. I found it cool how playing with colors 
    in rows and columns led to cool gradient animations.
